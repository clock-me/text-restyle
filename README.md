# text-restyle

## About
This repo contains my re-implementation of paper [Multiple-Attribute Text Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00552). It was done completely by me, in short time and basically as a programming challenge, so it may contain _a lot of bugs_. If you found one (and you probably will, if you try), please feel free to contact me/open an issue.

## Usage
At first, clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/clock-me/text-restyle.git
cd text-restyle
```
Your data must be contained in `train.tsv`, `val.tsv`, and `test.tsv` for train set, validation set and test set respectively (names for files are arbitrary). All the data must be already preprocessed (but not necessarily tokenized). Examples of data may be found in folder `data_examples`. Also train configuration must be stored in `yaml` file. Example of such is `config.yaml`.
To run training one can use `train.py`:
```
train.py [-h] [--do_preprocess]
         path_to_config path_to_train path_to_val path_to_test
```
Where `do_preprocess` stands for "whether create files for subword tokenization or not". This flag must be raised in the first run.

## TODO
- [ ] Add testing utilities (Metrics such as self-bleu (which is arguably the worst in text-style-transfer), style accuracy)
- [ ] Add complex style support (in this case, style is a vector, as in the paper)
- [ ] Reproduce paper results

## Work examples
The model with trained with hyperparameters, described in `config.yaml`. I used the _yelp_ data, preprocessed & provided by https://github.com/shentianxiao/language-style-transfer. Here are some examples, generated by model (code is availible at `sandbox.ipynb`). These are generated with greedy decoding.
